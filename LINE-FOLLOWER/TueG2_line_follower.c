/********************************************************************************
 Platform: SPARK V
 Experiment: 4_Motion_Control_Simple
 Written by: Vinod Desai, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Edited By: Sachitanand Malewar, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Last Modification: 22nd September 2010
 AVR Studio Version 4.17, Build 666

 Concepts covered: I/O interfacing, motion control using L293D 

 This experiment demonstrates simple motion control using L293D Motor driver IC.

 There are two components to the motion control:
 1. Direction control using pins PORTB0 to 	PORTB3
 2. Velocity control using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) on pins PD4 and PD5.

 Pulse width modulation is a process in which duty cycle of constant frequency square wave is modulated to 
 control power delivered to the load i.e. motor. 

 In this experiment for the simplicity PWM pins, PD4 and PD5 are kept at logic 1.
 Use of PWM will be covered in the "5_Velocity_Control_Using_PWM" experiment.
   
 Connection Details:  	L-1---->PB0;		L-2---->PB1;
   						R-1---->PB2;		R-2---->PB3;
   						PD4 (OC1B) ----> Logic 1; 	PD5 (OC1A) ----> Logic 1; 

 Make sure that motors are connected to onboard motor connectors.
 
 For more detail refer to hardware and software manual

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega16
 	Frequency: 7372800Hz
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper 
	              optimization options below figure 4.22 in the hardware manual)
